# BellowsCalculator
A calculator to generate a design of a wanted bellows. I made it so that I can cut it out using a laser engraver directly, and use the end result as the paper-skeleton in a home made camera bellows.

It will generate 5 parts where the top and bottom part is eventually same size as the middle one in the image. It can output as PNG and/or SVG.

### Front Opening Width: 
> Width opening at lens side
### Front Opening Height:
> Height opening at lens side
### Rear Opening Width: 
> Rear width at film side
### Rear Opening Height:
> Rear height at film side
### Extended Length:
> Length of bellows when epanded as much as mechanically possible
### Number of Folds:
> Self explained (auto)
### Normal Fold Depth:
> Depth between each fold
### End Pleat Depth:
> Depth if the first folds closest to the lens.
### Material Thickness:
> Not needed but should calculate thickness of the bellows when compressed.
### Inner Pleat Line Reduction:
> Adjusts the line length if the three inner parts. As the skeleton is desired to hold together, I reduce its length so it will do just that.
### Outer Pleat Line Reduction:
> Same as above, but affects the halfs (top/bottom) in the design.
### Pleat Line Thickness:
> Thickness of the lines. I want these fairly thick to reduce bellows thickness and improve its function.
### Outer Cut Line Offset:
> Reduce or lengthen the skeleton slightly to make it easier to handle.
### Outer Border-line thickness:
> The cut-out line. Normally wanted fairly thin.
### Corner Fold Length Reduction:
> To make the skeleton print to hold together you may want to reduce this some depending on bellow size.
### Corner Fold Outline Thickness:
> If for some reason the four black corner parts to be a little thicker. Typically by preference.
